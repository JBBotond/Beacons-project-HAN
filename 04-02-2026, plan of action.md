## backgrounds
this project will be to create a reverse geohash box to guide a group of 8-10 year old children trough the Brokhorst company, with this they want the kids to get the kids interested in exploring the company and teach them what steps a product goes trough during development.

## problem definition
the goal of this project is, as mentioned in background, create a box that guides a group of children trough a reverse geocache. this geocache should have 5 rooms where they will solve a puzzle to be lead to the next room. this should be done in a way engaging for children and teaches them about thee company and its environment.

## project result
to satisfy the customer's wishes and create a product engaging for kids and save. therefore the box needs several admin features that will not be accessible during general usage, admin features include things such as a external application on a computer where the box can connect to that will show information of the route a user took. a way to set, reset and remove beacons when in admin mode and to set answers that lead to the next beacon. 

additionally the box needs to be save for kid usage and possibly also kid resistant so that they can be rough with it if they like. 

## project activity
we plan to deliver in 2 phases to make sure we are on the right track, the first phase will hold the essentials such as the pc application and the box without any features, just the system without puzzles and puzzle features. After this is approved we will work on this and add the puzzles and puzzle features for the final product.

## product organisation
there are 4 members in our project group; Biaggio, Boti, Danyil and Bauke
we have distributed loose roles according to our strengths and weaknesses tough these are not set in stone.

Biaggio: Hardware
Boti: Programming
Daniel: Programming and documentation makeup
Bauke:  Documentation and 3d modelling

as for the general flow of the project we regularly have meetings to discuss ideas for the project and how to implement each part. 
## planning

as mentioned in product activity, we plan to split the project into two phases. in the first phase we will have basic functionality of the application and the box.
