#### **Background and context** 	

-background is pretty short and solid but still needs some more information like why they want to make kids interested in exploring and learning the product. ( lack of explaining for the problem). some relates to what it needs but not clear about the overall goal for this. So yeah Background is clear but context is not really clear at all. 

TODO:
- why interest the kids
- improve context of background

#### **Problem definition:**

-The problem is clear:

o	Highlight the specific type of customer

o	Clarify the objective is to deliver the information about the company and its environment

o	Handin the most important issue: the box should lead the children to each room so that they can solve the puzzle

#### **Project result:**

\-	Their expected result is also very clear:

o	The team has identified the customer’s demand, so they can expect a clear final result

o	The result contains most of the crucial demands:

	Easily manage by the administrator and won’t be accessible for kids

	Solid enough to make sure that kids can have fun will play with the box and the box won’t be easily break, which can may hurt the child

	Short and straight to their main point, not beating around the bush

#### **project activity** 

\- clear about all the activity. timelines and resources are really solid and all the activities logically lead to the intended outcomes. some of the potential challenges and risks are not identifies solely. besides that every activities are broken down into clear steps that makes the plan easy

TODO:
- identify challenges and risks

#### **Project organisation**

The roles are clearly assigned, maybe you could add who is making the main decisions, is there a member that mostly leads the project? A little bit about the communication with the client could also be added.

TODO:
- decision making member/lead member
- communication with client

#### **Planning timeline**

Time line is clear , deadlines are realistic. Deadlines can be more detailed later on. Planning doesnt specify who is going to do what but it can be better to decide these later in some cases

TODO: 
- ?maybe? blueprint of who does what
