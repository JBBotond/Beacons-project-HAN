Main unit: NXP microcontroller
The microcontroller must have the order of ibeacons and their respective UUID's programmed into it before the "game" begins via the admin panel. The system automatically indicates distance from the next ibeacon in the given order. The display will indicate whether the user is getting closer or further from the ibeacon (hotter or colder game). Once the user has reached the ibeacons, an event is triggered to reward the user, or offer clues to a bigger prize in the end.
